**Feature Branch**: `002-add-middleware-for-agent-interaction`
**Created**: 2025-09-23

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer or system user, I want to submit natural language queries that will be processed by an LLM model (OpenAI gpt-4o or Huawei MaaS) which can intelligently use database tools to retrieve information and provide accurate, context-aware responses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user query about database tables, **When** the query is submitted through the API, **Then** the system should use the configured LLM provider to understand the query, invoke appropriate MCP database tools, and return a natural language response with the requested information

2. **Given** an MCP server running in SSE mode, **When** a client sends a query, **Then** the middleware should establish an SSE connection, process the query with the selected LLM provider, execute tools, and return results

3. **Given** an MCP server running in stdio mode, **When** a client sends a query, **Then** the middleware should establish a stdio connection, process the query with the selected LLM provider, execute tools, and return results

4. **Given** multiple tool calls are needed to answer a query, **When** the AI processes the request, **Then** it should execute all necessary tools in sequence and compile a comprehensive response

5. **Given** a tool execution fails, **When** processing a query, **Then** the system should handle the error gracefully and inform the user of the limitation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the selected LLM API (OpenAI or Huawei MaaS) is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does system handle when MCP server connection is lost during query processing?
- What happens when tool execution exceeds timeout limits?
- How does the system handle ambiguous queries that could use multiple tools?
- What happens when the response size exceeds reasonable limits?

### End-to-End Testing Requirements
- **E2E-001**: Test suite MUST verify complete query lifecycle with actual LLM calls
- **E2E-002**: Tests MUST cover both stdio and SSE transport modes independently
- **E2E-003**: Tests MUST verify successful tool discovery and invocation
- **E2E-004**: Tests MUST validate response generation with tool results
- **E2E-005**: Tests MUST confirm proper error handling across the pipeline
- **E2E-006**: Tests MUST verify both OpenAI and Huawei MaaS providers work correctly
- **E2E-007**: Tests MUST validate fallback behavior when primary provider fails

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language queries from users via a standardized API endpoint
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI gpt-4o and Huawei MaaS) via abstraction layer
- **FR-003**: System MUST connect to MCP servers using both stdio and SSE transport protocols via abstraction layer
- **FR-004**: System MUST dynamically discover available MCP tools from connected servers
- **FR-005**: System MUST translate LLM function calls to appropriate MCP tool invocations
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle tool execution results and incorporate them into AI responses
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide both synchronous function interface and asynchronous API endpoint for query processing
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain conversation context for follow-up queries within a session
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle connection failures gracefully with automatic retry (max 3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate and sanitize user inputs before processing
- **FR-011**: System MUST support configuration of LLM provider via environment variables (LLM_PROVIDER defaults to 'openai')

- **FR-013**: System MUST support concurrent request handling (MVP: 10 concurrent requests maximum)

- **FR-016**: System MUST log all tool invocations for debugging and monitoring purposes
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide transport abstraction layer allowing runtime selection between stdio and SSE
- **FR-018**: System MUST support both OpenAI and Huawei MaaS configuration through environment variables
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow enabling/disabling of transport modes through configuration

- **FR-024**: System MUST validate provider-specific configurations on startup (API keys, endpoints)
- **FR-025**: System MUST maintain consistent tool calling interface regardless of LLM provider

### Key Entities
- **Query**: User's natural language request, with optional session context
- **AIResponse**: Structured response containing the answer, tool calls made, and metadata
- **MCPConnection**: Connection instance to an MCP server with transport type and status
- **ToolInvocation**: Record of a tool call including parameters, results, and execution time
- **Session**: Container for conversation history and context between related queries
- **TransportAdapter**: Abstraction for stdio/SSE communication with MCP servers
- **LLMProvider**: Abstraction for LLM service integration (OpenAI, Huawei MaaS)

### Architectural Guidelines
- **Transport Abstraction**: System MUST implement clean separation between transport logic and business logic
  - Base transport interface defining common operations
  - SSE transport implementation in dedicated module (transport/sse)
  - Stdio transport implementation in dedicated module (transport/stdio)
  - Transport manager for runtime selection and switching
- **LLM Provider Abstraction**: System MUST implement provider-agnostic interface for LLM interactions
  - Base LLM provider interface defining common operations
  - OpenAI provider implementation (providers/openai)
  - Huawei MaaS provider implementation (providers/huawei_maas)
  - Provider manager for runtime selection and configuration validation
- **Configuration Management**: All external service configurations via environment variables
  - LLM_PROVIDER: Selected LLM provider ('openai' or 'huawei_maas', default: 'openai')
  - OPENAI_API_KEY: API key for OpenAI (required when LLM_PROVIDER='openai')
  - OPENAI_MODEL: Model to use (default: 'gpt-4o', only gpt-4o supported)
  - MAAS_MODEL_NAME: Huawei MaaS model identifier
  - MAAS_API_URL: Huawei MaaS API endpoint (OpenAI-compatible)
  - MAAS_API_KEY: Authentication key for Huawei MaaS
  - MCP_TRANSPORT: Default transport mode (stdio/sse)
  - MCP_SERVER_URL: MCP server endpoint for SSE mode
- **MVP Rate Limiting Strategy**:
  - Token bucket algorithm with 10 tokens per minute per client IP
  - Graceful degradation with clear error messages when limit exceeded
  - Headers indicating rate limit status (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining)
  - Reset window of 60 seconds
