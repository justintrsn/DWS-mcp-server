## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Multiple clients need to concurrently query a PostgreSQL database through an MCP server with built-in connection pooling and rate limiting to ensure fair resource usage and system stability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** 5 clients request data simultaneously, **When** all connections are busy, **Then** requests queue with position feedback
2. **Given** a client exceeds 10 requests/minute, **When** making another request, **Then** rate limit error with retry timing
3. **Given** a recoverable error occurs, **When** client retries after suggested delay, **Then** operation succeeds
4. **Given** a non-recoverable error occurs, **When** client retries without changes, **Then** same error persists
5. **Given** a client sends a query with filters, **When** using allowed operators (=, !=, >, <, LIKE, IN), **Then** query executes successfully
6. **Given** a query runs longer than 30 seconds, **When** timeout is reached, **Then** query is automatically cancelled

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all 10 connections are exhausted? System queues up to 15 requests and returns busy error with queue position for additional requests
- How does system handle malformed filter syntax? Returns non-recoverable error with specific fix suggestions
- What happens during database connection loss? Attempts automatic reconnection for recoverable failures
- How are slow queries handled? Queries exceeding 30-second timeout are automatically cancelled

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Connection Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain connection pool with maximum 10 connections
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement automatic reconnection for recoverable failures
- **FR-003**: System MUST queue up to 15 requests when connections busy
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide fair scheduling across 5 concurrent clients using round-robin

2**Rate Limiting & Protection**
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce 10 requests per minute per client
- **FR-006**: System MUST cancel queries exceeding 30-second timeout
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent single client from consuming more than 40% of resources

**Error Classification**
- **FR-008**: System MUST categorize all errors as recoverable or non-recoverable
- **FR-009**: System MUST include retry guidance in error responses
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide actionable fix suggestions for non-recoverable errors

### Key Entities

- **Connection Pool**: Manages up to 10 database connections with 2x safety margin for 5 concurrent users
- **Request Queue**: Holds up to 15 pending requests (average 3 per user) with position tracking
- **Client Session**: Tracks individual client request patterns for rate limiting (10/minute max)
- **Error Response**: Structured response containing error code, message, retryable flag, and fix suggestions

## Clarifications Resolved

### Authentication Method
- System will use environment variables for database credentials
- Credentials stored separately from MCP server configuration
- API authentication runs concurrently on same server but as independent service

### Filter Operations Allowed
Recommended operators for security and usability:
- Comparison: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Pattern Matching: LIKE (with % wildcards)
- List Operations: IN (comma-separated values)
- Null Checks: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
- Logical: AND, OR (max 3 conditions to prevent complexity)
- Example: age > 18 AND status = 'active' or name LIKE 'John%'

### Recoverable vs Non-Recoverable Errors

**Recoverable Errors** (client can retry):
- Temporary connection loss (network blip)
- Database timeout due to load
- Lock conflicts on tables
- Server at capacity
- Response includes: "retryable": true, "retry_after": 5

**Non-Recoverable Errors** (client must fix something):
- Invalid table/column names
- Malformed filter syntax
- Authentication failure
- Permission denied
- Data type mismatch
- Response includes: "retryable": false, "fix_required": "Check column name"

### Logging Specification
- Format: Structured logs with timestamp, severity, component, message
- Levels: ERROR (failures), WARNING (degraded performance), INFO (operations), DEBUG (detailed traces)
- What to Log:
  - All database connection attempts
  - Query executions with duration
  - Error occurrences with stack traces
  - Client request patterns
  - Resource usage warnings
- Retention: 7 days rolling logs, archive monthly summaries

### Timeout Values (Standard)
- Connection timeout: 10 seconds
- Query timeout: 30 seconds
- Idle connection timeout: 300 seconds
- Metadata refresh: 3600 seconds (1 hour cache)

### Error Response Format (Standard)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "COLUMN_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Column 'custmer_id' does not exist",
    "details": {
      "table": "customers",
      "available_columns": ["customer_id", "name", "email"],
      "suggestion": "Did you mean 'customer_id'?"
    },
    "retryable": false,
    "timestamp": "2025-09-12T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Environment variables will be read once at startup
- Connection pool initialized on first request
- Graceful degradation when approaching capacity
- MCP server supports both stdio and SSE transport modes
- Health monitoring provided via separate HTTP API service (not MCP tool)

### Transport Modes
- **stdio**: Standard input/output for command-line integration
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: HTTP-based streaming for web clients
- Both modes share same tool implementations and connection pool

### Health Monitoring Service
- Separate HTTP API running on configurable port (default: 8080)
- Endpoints:
  - `/health` - Overall system health status
  - `/health/database` - Database connection pool status
  - `/health/metrics` - Request rates and performance metrics
- Independent from MCP protocol for monitoring tools compatibility
